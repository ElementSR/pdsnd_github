### Project Title
Bikeshare data analysis program

### Description
This python program analyses the Bikeshare data files for the cities of Chicago, Washington, and New York City.
It reads the csv files and asks users to choose a city to analyse along with an optional choice of month and day of the week.
It will then display various calculations based on the filtered data and provide users the option to print raw data for the user.
Finally, it will give the option to restart the process or terminate.

### Files used
- chicago.csv
- washington.csv
- new_york_city.csv

Used documentation on the following websites to look up arguments and understand how functions worked using examples:
- https://www.python.org/
- https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp
- https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/

I used the calendar module from these solutions to parse datetime ints and convert between abbreviations
